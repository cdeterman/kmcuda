Title: 'Yingyang' K-Means and K-NN using NVIDIA CUDA

Description: K-means implementation is base on "Yingyang K-Means: A Drop-In Replacement of the Classic K-Means with Consistent Speedup". While it introduces some overhead and many ocnditional clauses which are bad for CUDA, it still shows 1.6-2x speedup agains thte Lloyd algorithm.  K-nearest neighbors employ the same triangle inequality idea and require precalculated centroids and cluster assignments, similar to the flattend ball tree.
